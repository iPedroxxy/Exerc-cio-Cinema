# Exercise Cinema
<p align="left">During my study of HTML and CSS, I immersed myself in creating my first practical exercise, focused on building a cinema website featuring movie sessions in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Using HTML to structure the elements and CSS to style them, I successfully highlighted the information in a clear and appealing manner.<br><br>In Rio de Janeiro, the list of available movies includes:<br><br>"Lisbela and the Prisoner" at 8:00 PM - Today (highlighted in a specific color)<br>"My Name Isn't Johnny" at 9:00 PM - Today (highlighted in another color)<br>"The Smell of the Drain" at 3:00 PM - Tomorrow (another color for differentiation)<br>Meanwhile, in São Paulo, the movies showing are:<br><br>"Lisbela and the Prisoner" at 8:00 PM - Today (different colors to distinguish)<br>"My Name Isn't Johnny" at 9:00 PM - Tomorrow<br>"The Smell of the Drain" at 3:00 PM - Tomorrow<br>This practice not only allowed me to apply the fundamental principles of HTML and CSS but also to create a visually appealing interface, highlighting the essential information about the movies and their sessions in each state. This initial experience will certainly serve as a solid starting point to enhance my skills in web development.</p>
